# Module: accounts.py

## Overview
This module implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It provides functionalities to create an account, deposit and withdraw funds, buy and sell shares, calculate portfolio value, and report profits or losses. It prevents invalid transactions such as excessive withdrawal, overbuying, or selling shares not owned. The module relies on an external function `get_share_price(symbol)` to fetch the current share price.

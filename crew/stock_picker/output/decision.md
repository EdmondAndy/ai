The companies that were not selected are:

1. **Bware Labs**: Despite its promising position in the evolving blockchain sector and support from Ethereum-focused investors, the market's growth is still in nascent stages compared to AI's broader adoption.

2. **Ama Care**: Although specializing in advancing healthcare technologies with AI integration, the regulatory complexities and slower pace of adoption in healthcare technologies present challenges compared to the rapidly expanding AI market.

3. **Transfix**: Even with substantial funding and innovative solutions in logistics, the economic uncertainties in the logistics sector make it less appealing compared to the more predictable growth trajectory of AI.
